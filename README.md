Abstract -

“HELLO DROMOMANIAC” project illustrates the designing and implementation of a Travel Management System. My project portrays itself as a record managing application which provides an explicit support for tourist in querying the availabilities of package, displaying its cost and confirm with the booking.

The primary aim of is to improve accuracy and enhance safety and efficiency in the organization of voluminous data. Today management is one of the most essential features of all form. Management provides sophistication to perform any kind of task in a particular form. My project is used to manage tourism related activities.

The exclusive use of the database allows the agency to may even include any new tourist package in the record; and enabling for the optimized booking facility to the users by using a review system.

The reason why I selected this project is the current Travel system is mostly based on manual work; however, there may be some exceptions to this as some agencies do not rely on fully furnished computerized system but generate tickets for the packages opted. There is a high need of revolution in the tourism industry in India. Also, raising of environmental awareness is of utmost importance as our future is dangling in the hands of Mother Earth. So, I believe in pragmatic approach and that encouraged me to promote ecotourism in my project.

The use of database improves the efficiency of the agency by reducing the tedious job of the travel agent and thus making it more responsible for the well-being of the citizen of a nation.
